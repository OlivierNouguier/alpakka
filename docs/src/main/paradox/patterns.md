# Integration Patterns

Many [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.eaipatterns.com/toc.html) can be implemented with Akka Streams 
(see [Java documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/java/stream/index.html) or [Scala documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/stream/index.html)).

TODO: Create documentation pages for typical integration patterns and some might deserve a higher level component that is implemented in Alpakka. [Contributions](https://github.com/akka/alpakka/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are very welcome.
[Creating an issue](https://github.com/akka/alpakka/issues) for discussion is a good first step for such contributions.
